# BusbyHReverseItEndpoint

This program takes a input and then reverses the input while showing the original input in the response. This program uses the (variable).Length command to see what the response is going to be in reverse.

Peer reviewed by: Arely Martinez : The program worked as intended. My input was revered and I was shown my original input as well. Harrison’s code was very neat, making it easy to read and understand what was going on.  Try adding in more in the return so the user knows what’s going on though. Like original output: and your output but reversed: Overall looks good.
