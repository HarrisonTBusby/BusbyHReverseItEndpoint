//Reverse It Endpoint
//Peer reviewed by: Arely Martinez : The program worked as intended. My input was revered and I was shown my original input as well. 
//Harrisonâ€™s code was very neat, making it easy to read and understand what was going on.  
//Try adding in more in the return so the user knows whatâ€™s going on though. Like original output: and your output but reversed: â€¦ Overall looks good.
